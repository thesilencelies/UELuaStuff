# UELuaStuff
UnrealEngine plugin that preloads some torch libs so that they are available at runtime so that scripts run.

It's currently bugged. But if you want to use it/test it then you'll need to change the LuaPath variables to wherever the install of torch is on your computer
(or do it properly then push it here like a hero)
