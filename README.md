# UELuaStuff
UnrealEngine plugin that preloads some torch libs so that they are available at runtime so that scripts run.

It's currently bugged. But if you want to use it/test it then you'll need to change the LuaPath variables in source/UEAutCam/UEAutCam.build.cs and source/UEAutCam/private/UEAutCam.cpp to the right place on your computer.

to wherever the install of torch is on your computer
(or do it properly then push it here like a hero)
